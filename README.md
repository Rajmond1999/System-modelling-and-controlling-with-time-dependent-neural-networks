# System-modelling-and-controlling-with-time-dependent-neural-networks

--- Parts of the project are in Hungarian, like the documentation

The goal of this project is creating an environment for creating and teaching time dependent neural networks under Matlab Simulink, then translating them to VHDL language, so they can run on an FPGA chip for modelling and real time control.
