This is the template of a fully connected neural network in VHDL

The NeuralNetwork is the top module
The compiler has to set to VHDL 2008, otherwiise it will have problems with the fix point arithmetics
The code rins in Vicado 2021.2

The Neurons are controlled by the StateController. The StateController gives command to the neurons, like miltiply and add or give the output etc.
The IOController deciddes what should be the neurons input based on the StateControllers commands.
